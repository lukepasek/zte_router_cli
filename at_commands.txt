We need your support to check b2,b5 and b32 controlling by AT commands on original firmware. Like I wrote we cannot test those bands in Poland and we do not have those bands even in our original gui.

Please avoid USB/uart adapter made on CH340 because one generates "bushes" on startup.
Properly working adapted is made on CP2102 oe PL2303.
Please connect PC with eg. teratem app via USB/uart cable and try to control modem module by means of AT commands as below:

Examples of AT command sending:
echo -e -n 'AT+ZNLOCKBAND=1,0,80005,0\r' > /dev/ttyUSB1
echo -e -n 'AT+ZCAINFO?\r' > /dev/ttyUSB1 && grep -m1 "ZCAINFO:" /dev/ttyUSB1
echo -e -n 'AT+ZNLOCKBAND?\r' > /dev/ttyUSB1 && grep -m1 "ZNLOCKBAND:" /dev/ttyUSB1


Band locking examples:
AT+ZNLOCKBAND=1,0,1,0 - Band 1
AT+ZNLOCKBAND=1,0,4,0 - Band 3
AT+ZNLOCKBAND=1,0,40,0 - Band 7
AT+ZNLOCKBAND=1,0,80000,0 - Band 20
AT+ZNLOCKBAND=1,0,41,0 - Band B1 +B7
AT+ZNLOCKBAND=1,0,45,0 - Band B1 + B3 + B7
AT+ZNLOCKBAND=1,0,80040,0 Band 7 + 20
AT+ZNLOCKBAND=1,0,80005,0 Band 20 + 1 +3
AT+ZNLOCKBAND=1,0,2,0 - Band 2
AT+ZNLOCKBAND=1,0,10,0 - Band 5
AT+ZNLOCKBAND=1,0,80000000,0 - Band 32
AT+ZNLOCKBAND=1,0,20080800C5,0 - All bands, this value is valid for polish bands, for english bands can be different
you can calculate proper value for eg. b1+b3+b32 by simple sum
Probably "real" all bands will have:
AT+ZNLOCKBAND=1,0,20880800D7,0

Other commands for your information
AT commands for APN setting:
AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","internet","",0,0
AT+CGACT=1,1

aggregation information:
AT+ZCAINFO? returns state

primary cell information:
AT+ZCELLINFO? returns state
+ZCELLINFO: 70938895, 307, LTE B20, 6350

Permanent pci/earfcn locking, to remove locking see below:
AT+ZLOCKCELL=? command syntax help
AT+ZLOCKCELL:earfcn_tag,pci_tag
AT+ZLOCKCELL? returns state
AT+ZLOCKCELL=6350,307 here sets locking to earfcn=6350 and pci=307
and then AT+CFUN=1,1

Permanent pci/earfcn locking removal:
AT+ZLOCKCELL=0
and then modem restart by AT+CFUN=1,1 or router power reboot

locked bands information:
AT+ZNLOCKBAND? returns state
+ZNLOCKBAND: 80005,2000000680380

uplink aggregation information:
AT+ZULCA? returns state
AT+ZULCA=1 enables uplink aggregation
AT+ZULCA=0 disables upling aggregation

Modem rebooting:
AT+CFUN=1,1

Modem state:
AT+CFUN?
